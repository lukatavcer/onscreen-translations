# ONSCREEN translations


## Bugs

### CAREGIVER TAB
1) "recentCalls" this section has time since the call in English, probably just a missing locale for the datetime plugin, example: "Yesterday at 2:58 PM" + "Missed" is not translated.
2) Registration email is in English
3) The name of the person in the Favorites section ("Luka's Priljubljeni" -> "Priljubljeni stiki osebe Žiga")
4) When adding a person by email to favorites (without entering email and clicking add) "Invalid email" is not translated -> "Napačen e-naslov"
5) When adding a person from your contacts (maybe if he has more than 1 number) and clicking on it "Select Phone Number" is not translated -> "Izberi telefonsko številko"
6) When removing "favorite invitation" the- texts "Remove invitation", "Are you sure?", button Cancel are not translated:
    - Remove invitation -> "Odstrani povabilo"
    - Are you sure? -> "Ali ste prepričani, da želite odstraniti povabilo?"
    - Cancel -> "Prekliči"
7)  weekday names in the "selectDatesToEnableAutoAnswer" settings section are not translated


## ŽAN & LUKA notes

1) Translation for "Dnevne posodobitve" (vizite, daily checkins)
