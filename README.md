## Bugs

### CAREGIVER TAB
1) "TV Settings" and "Don't switch" in the select input when selecting HDMI inputs are not translated
2) weekday names in the "Daily Updates" settings section are not translated & time select input also has English locale
3) "thisIsTheHDMIPortThatYouPlugged" and "thisIsTheHDMIPort" texrs are the same
4) "recentCalls" this section has time since the call in English, probably just a missing locale for the datetime plugin, example: "Yesterday at 2:58 PM" + "Missed" is not translated.
5) in the "recentCalls" section "Show More" & "Show Less" are not translated
6) Registration email is in English
7) The name of the person in the Favorites section ("Luka's Priljubljeni" -> "Priljubljeni stiki osebe Žiga")
8) When adding a person by email to favorites (without entering email and clicking add) "Invalid email" is not translated -> "Napačen e-naslov"
9) When adding a person from your contacts and clicking on it "Select Phone Number" is not translated -> "Izberi telefonsko številko"
