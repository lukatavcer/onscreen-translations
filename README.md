# ONSCREEN translations


## Bugs

### CAREGIVER TAB
1) "TV Settings" and "Don't switch" in the select input when selecting HDMI inputs are not translated
2) weekday names in the "Daily Updates" section are not translated & time select input also has English locale
3) "thisIsTheHDMIPortThatYouPlugged" and "thisIsTheHDMIPort" texrs are the same
4) "recentCalls" this section has time since the call in English, probably just a missing locale for the datetime plugin, example: "Yesterday at 2:58 PM" + "Missed" is not translated.
5) Registration email is in English


## Å½AN & LUKA notes

1) Translation for "Dnevne posodobitve" (vizite, daily checkins)
